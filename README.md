# [Project 1: Payment Date Prediction: Project Overview](https://github.com/anshu1516/Anshu_Portfolio/blob/main/Payment%20date%20prediction.ipynb)
1. Understood the dataset and meaning of the terms used in columns and identified the problem.
2. Learned some basic machine learning steps and techniques to wrangle the problem.
3. Reason for splitting on a date basis:- Since in some of the use cases we will always be making predictions for the future data, we will have to make the train, validation, and test split based on a date instead of a random split. For example, if we are training the model for data between January and September, the validation set can be from October to mid of November and the test set from mid of November and onwards.
4. Learned some basic machine learning algorithms like linear regression and decision tree and increased the model efficiency by 28%.
